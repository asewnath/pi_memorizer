# Ï€ memorizer

When I was in middle school, I memorized around 160 digits of pi to win
ten points of extra credit in math class. As I was preparing for the
competition, I noticed that I developed my own system for learning digits of pi.
This tool, pi_memorizer, mimics my approach.

Enjoy! I hope you can use this tool to memorize some digits of pi to
impress people on pi day!
