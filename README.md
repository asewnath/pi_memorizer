# π memorizer

When I was in middle school, I memorized around 160 digits of π to win
ten points of extra credit in math class. As I was preparing for the
competition, I noticed that I had developed my own system for learning π.
This tool, pi_memorizer, mimics my approach.

Enjoy! I hope you can use this tool to memorize some digits of π to
impress people on π day!
